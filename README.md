# Finance Tracker

A second-generation personal finance tracker built around trustworthy data, transparent calculations, and privacy-first handling of financial information.

**North Star:** a dependable personal finance dashboard for iPhone and iPad. Target MVP date: **January 1, 2027**.

> **Privacy warning:** This repository is public. Never commit real financial data, account exports, statements, credentials, access tokens, or production secrets. Assume everything committed here can be read by anyone.

## Project status

The project is in discovery and foundation. **MVP1 uses user-provided CSV imports.** Free, authorized direct integrations are an MVP2 research goal, not a dependency for the first release. No backend, database, or authentication provider has been selected.

## Non-negotiable constraints

1. No recurring costs for hosting, storage, aggregation, refresh, or AI.
2. No real personal financial data or secrets in this public repository.
3. No stored bank passwords, unauthorized scraping, or reliance on expiring trials.
4. Manual file imports remain a permanent fallback.
5. Do not begin production implementation until data access, storage, authentication, and security architecture are documented and reviewed.
6. Distinguish verified facts, user-confirmed observations, hypotheses, and open questions.

## Working approach

Use focused branches and pull requests. Do not push directly to `main`, force-push, rewrite shared history, or merge without explicit authorization. Update documentation when decisions change.

No license has been selected. Until one is added, do not assume the project grants permission to reuse its code.
